# DOM Manipulation Practice Repository

This repository is a learning playground for DOM manipulation — from **basic** to **advanced**. It contains clear, line-by-line commented solutions, guided exercises, and a minimal starter.
Open files in your browser or (recommended) use a local server like VS Code Live Server.

## Structure
- `start/` — Minimal starter demo.
- `lessons/` — Topic-based exercises and solutions:
  - `01-basics/`
  - `02-events/`
  - `03-traversal/`
  - `04-attributes-classes-styles/`
  - `05-forms/`
  - `06-async-fetch/`
  - `shared.css` (shared styles for lessons)

## Quick start
1. Open `start/index.html` or a lesson `exercise.html` in your browser.
2. For fetch examples, run a local server (e.g., VS Code Live Server) to avoid CORS issues.
3. Explore the `solution.html/js` after attempting the `exercise.html/js` yourself.

```bash
git init
