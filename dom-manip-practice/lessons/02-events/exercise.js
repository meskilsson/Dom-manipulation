// YOUR GOALS:
// - Listen for the form submit and add a new <li> with a checkbox, text, and delete button.
// - Use ONE click listener on #todo-list to handle both: toggle complete & delete (delegation).
// - Update the counts after every change.
// - Bonus: save todos in localStorage and load on start.
